The combination of certain shapes and<br>&nbsp;colors already have a defined connotation in our subconscious. For<br>example, a yellow circle usually represents the sun, while a red<br>half-circle can represent a slice of watermelon. Unless you are trying to send a direct message with your composition, ***shapes and colors are mostly an accessory*** and should be considered as such.<br><br>## *Using Shapes to Create Something Else*<br><br>![How-to-Creatively-Use-Shapes&nbsp;to-Make-Your-Designs-Stand-Out-geometric meanings](<a data-fr-linked="true" href="https://visme.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Using-shapes-to-create-something-else-01.jpg">https://visme.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Using-shapes-to-create-something-else-01.jpg</a>)<br><br>You can also ***use shapes as elements of a larger image*** .<br>&nbsp;A group of violet circles, for example, can be combined to form a bunch<br>&nbsp;of grapes; a white rectangle and two white triangles can come together<br>to form an envelope; a few squares and rectangles can make a house. All<br>these possibilities and more are out there for you to play with. But you<br>&nbsp;must think about what your end goal is.<br><br>Do you want to design your own<br>branded icons? Or create your own backgrounds? Do you want to combine<br>your photos into a collage that represents something, like the shape of a<br>&nbsp;fish, for example? Shapes are your best allies for these kinds of<br>creations. All you have to do is play with them until you arrive at a<br>composition you like.<br><br>## *Using Shapes as Accessories*<br><br>For designs like presentations,<br>infographics and social media graphics, shapes are more commonly used as<br>&nbsp;accessories or complements. This doesn&rsquo;t mean that they are less<br>important&mdash;on the contrary! As accessories, they say more on their own.<br><br>How we place our accessory shapes can tell many different stories. There is a** psychology behind shapes**<br>&nbsp;that you may not even be aware of. There are emotions and<br>feelings evoked by certain shapes, inspired by cultural conventions and<br>forms seen in nature. We cannot create without shapes. Even the paper we<br>&nbsp;write or draw on is a shape; our screen is a shape!<br><br>Let&rsquo;s go further into understanding shapes and their (not so) hidden messages.<br><br>## *Geometric, Organic and Abstract Shapes*<br><br>![Geometric-Organic-and-Abstract How-to-Creatively-Use-Shapes&nbsp;to-Make-Your-Designs-Stand-Out-geometric meanings](<a data-fr-linked="true" href="https://visme.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Geometric-Organic-and-Abstract.jpg">https://visme.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Geometric-Organic-and-Abstract.jpg</a>)<br><br>Access thousands of shapes, icons and symbols for use in your graphics.[Try It for Free](<a data-fr-linked="true" href="https://www.visme.co/?vc=In-Text-Blog-CTA">https://www.visme.co/?vc=In-Text-Blog-CTA</a>)<br><br>All possible shapes fall into three main categories: geometric, organic and abstract.<br><br>### *Geometric*<br><br>Geometric shapes are the ones we<br>first learn about as little kids. They&apos;re the simplest, most common<br>shapes of all: squares, circles, triangles and their derivatives, such<br>as rectangles, ovals and polygons. Most geometric shapes are symmetrical<br>&nbsp;and instantly recognizable, but they also convey silent messages,<br>which I will cover later in this post.<br><br>### *Organic*<br><br>Organic shapes are those that<br>represent things we know about nature and life around us. The most<br>common organic shapes are plant-based, like flowers and leaves. Another<br>kind of organic shapes are those that represent forms we can create<br>ourselves, like paint splatters or watercolor blobs. These kinds of<br>shapes are mostly asymmetric and their kinds of lines can vary.<br><br>### *Abstract*<br><br>Abstract shapes are depictions of<br>real things without being exact representations. The icons we see in web<br>&nbsp;design, our phones and in street signs are abstract shapes that we are<br>quite used to seeing and can easily recognize. A great example of an<br>abstract shape is a stick figure, which represents a person. Symbols are<br>&nbsp;also considered abstract shapes.<br><br>## *Squares and Rectangles*<br><br>The shapes we come across the most in<br>&nbsp;designs and our everyday lives are squares and rectangles, in both<br>horizontal and vertical layouts. Street signs, shop signs, social media<br>headers, blog headers, business cards, sheets of paper&mdash;all are<br>rectangles.<br><br>The familiarity of squares and rectangles makes them easy to use as the base of a design or as a frame. &nbsp;**Squares and rectangles make us feel safe and contained** .<br>&nbsp;They give a sense of stability and assurance but also easily fall to<br>the background, and the feelings they convey are mostly subliminal.<br><br>### *The Rule of Thirds*<br><br>Using squares and rectangles as the<br>base of a composition is good practice. Experimenting with the way<br>rectangles and squares can be scaled and put together can serve as a<br>visual exercise when designing a new graphic. There is one very<br>important design practice called &nbsp;***the rule of thirds*** . It&rsquo;s all about how rectangles and lines control the balance in any composition.<br><br>![Rule-of-Thirds How-to-Creatively-Use-Shapes&nbsp;to-Make-Your-Designs-Stand-Out-geometric meanings](<a data-fr-linked="true" href="https://visme.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Rule-of-Thirds.jpg">https://visme.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Rule-of-Thirds.jpg</a>)<br><br>The best way to visualize the rule of thirds is as a grid. The best<br>websites are designed and developed following a grid. Graphic designers<br>use grids for better composition. Architects use grids for better<br>measurements. What are grids composed of? Squares and rectangles (and<br>sometimes triangles if you want to use a more complex perspective grid).<br><br>The rule of thirds is essentially a grid that separates your canvas space into nine equal sections. The idea behind this is that the human eye has a natural direction in which it prefers to move from object to object. The &nbsp;***most important areas are the intersection points*** ,<br>&nbsp;starting at the top left and then either the one on the immediate right<br>&nbsp;or straight down. The bottom right corner is the intersection point<br>that attracts the least attention.<br><br>[![Rule-of-Thirds How-to-Creatively-Use-Shapes&nbsp;to-Make-Your-Designs-Stand-Out-geometric meanings](<a data-fr-linked="true" href="https://visme.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Rule-of-Thirds1.jpg">https://visme.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Rule-of-Thirds1.jpg</a>)](<a data-fr-linked="true" href="https://visme.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Rule-of-Thirds1.jpg">https://visme.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Rule-of-Thirds1.jpg</a>)<br>[RELATED: 12 Visual Hierarchy Principles Every Non-Designer Needs to Know](<a data-fr-linked="true" href="https://visme.co/blog/visual-hierarchy/">https://visme.co/blog/visual-hierarchy/</a>)<br><br>## *Circles*<br><br>In design, circles have different<br>uses for different purposes. In logo design, for example, circles are<br>the most common and widely seen shape or background outline for a logo.<br>In websites, they are mostly used as buttons and small icons. Why is it<br>that we see so many circles used as accessory shapes in websites,<br>graphics and even infographics? The reason behind this is that circles<br>are very noticeable, and quite powerful.<br><br>&nbsp;***Circles represent wholeness** ,*<br>&nbsp;a natural sense of completion. When we think of things shaped as<br>circles in the world around us, there are so many things that we can<br>name.<br><br>![How-to-Creatively-Use-Shapes&nbsp;to-Make-Your-Designs-Stand-Out-geometric meanings some of the ways you can use circles as part of a design](<a data-fr-linked="true" href="https://visme.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Some-of-the-ways-you-can-use-circles-as-part-of-a-design.jpg">https://visme.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Some-of-the-ways-you-can-use-circles-as-part-of-a-design.jpg</a>)<br><br>### *Some things that circles can represent:*<br><br>* The Sun<br>* The Moon<br>* The Earth<br>* Any planet<br>* A ball<br>* An orange<br>* A ring or band<br>* A smiley face<br>* Buttons<br><br>![Circles-can-represent How-to-Creatively-Use-Shapes&nbsp;to-Make-Your-Designs-Stand-Out-geometric meanings](<a data-fr-linked="true" href="https://visme.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Circles-can-represent.jpg">https://visme.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Circles-can-represent.jpg</a>)<br><br>Take into consideration the power of a<br>&nbsp;circle and how it can affect your designs. Circles can represent<br>constant movement, such as spinning or rolling. The outline of a circle<br>can serve as a band or ring representing a cycle or continuing action. A<br>&nbsp;circle can represent a hole punched out on a page. A circle with a<br>subtle shadow effect can look like a sticker or button that has been<br>&ldquo;placed&rdquo; over the rest of the design.<br><br>## *Triangles*<br><br>Triangles have two meanings depending on their position. When pointing up, they ** represent stability and power** ,<br>&nbsp;when pointing down they become unstable. The triangle is primarily a<br>masculine shape, but when inverted it also represents female<br>reproduction. In spirituality, triangles represent the union of body,<br>mind, and spirit.<br><br>In design, skinny triangles can be<br>used instead of arrows or pointers. Smaller triangles can be used as<br>shapes in a collage with an interlocking composition or mosaic effect.<br>Larger triangles are more noticeable, so you should take into<br>consideration their meaning before using them in larger sizes. It is<br>always best to use triangles that sit comfortably on a base or with a<br>point facing to the right, conveying a message of moving forward.<br><br>![How-to-Creatively-Use-Shapes&nbsp;to-Make-Your-Designs-Stand-Out-geometric meanings triangles we see in everyday life](<a data-fr-linked="true" href="https://visme.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Triangles-we-see-in-everyday-life-01.jpg">https://visme.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Triangles-we-see-in-everyday-life-01.jpg</a>)<br><br>Create your own blog graphics in minutes with this drag-and-drop tool.[Try It for Free](<a data-fr-linked="true" href="https://www.visme.co/social-media-graphics/?vc=In-Text-Blog-CTA">https://www.visme.co/social-media-graphics/?vc=In-Text-Blog-CTA</a>)<br><br>### *Triangles we see in everyday life:*<br><br>* The &ldquo;play&rdquo; symbol<br>* The &ldquo;fast forward&rdquo; and &ldquo;reverse&rdquo; symbols<br>* Pyramids<br>* Mountains<br>* Pennants<br>* Pizza slices<br><br>Triangles can also be used to break<br>from the traditional, square design. They can be put together in<br>countless ways to create all sorts of dynamic designs, such as the one<br>below.<br><br>![Triangles-as-rule-breakers How-to-Creatively-Use-Shapes&nbsp;to-Make-Your-Designs-Stand-Out-geometric meanings](<a data-fr-linked="true" href="https://visme.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Triangles-as-rule-breakers.jpg">https://visme.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Triangles-as-rule-breakers.jpg</a>)<br><br>## *Pentagons, Hexagons and Octagons*<br><br>Pentagons, hexagons and octagons are<br>geometric shapes with five, six and eight sides respectively. These are<br>the most commonly used polygons with more than four sides. There are<br>lots more of course, but these three are the most versatile for creating<br>&nbsp;graphics.<br><br>Let&rsquo;s review what each of these<br>shapes are reminiscent of in our daily lives to best understand how they<br>&nbsp;can be used in our designs.<br><br>![How-to-Creatively-Use-Shapes&nbsp;to-Make-Your-Designs-Stand-Out-geometric meanings shapes we see in everyday life](<a data-fr-linked="true" href="https://visme.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Shapes-we-see-in-everyday-life-02.jpg">https://visme.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Shapes-we-see-in-everyday-life-02.jpg</a>)<br><br>### *Pentagons*<br><br>* The Pentagon Building in the US<br>* The black shapes on a soccer ball<br>* Some streets signs. For example: Children / School Crossing<br>* Symbol for house or dwelling<br><br>### *Hexagons*<br><br>* Bolts<br>* Floor tiles<br>* The white shapes on a soccer ball<br>* Sections of a beehive<br>* The shapes formed by fence wire<br><br>### *Octagons*<br><br>* Stop signs<br>* Open umbrellas<br>* Windows<br>* Tiles<br>* Candles<br><br>## *Using Polygons on Their Own*<br><br>A few simple ways to use any of these polygons is to &nbsp;***insert text inside of them or cut out images as shapes*** .<br>&nbsp;You can use these techniques in blog post header images, Pinterest<br>pins, Instagram graphics, YouTube thumbnails or presentation slides.<br><br>Using any of these polygons instead of a regular rectangle or square<br>will give your graphic a different feel from the usual. Understanding<br>the message behind each of these shapes is key to choosing the best one<br>for your brand or message. Use the list above to think about what these<br>shapes remind you of and consider how this affects your design.<br><br>## *Using Polygons as Interlocking Shapes*<br><br>![Using-Pentagons,-Hexagons-and-Octagons-as-interlocking-shapes How-to-Creatively-Use-Shapes&nbsp;to-Make-Your-Designs-Stand-Out-geometric meanings](<a data-fr-linked="true" href="https://visme.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Using-Pentagons-Hexagons-and-Octagons-as-interlocking-shapes.jpg">https://visme.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Using-Pentagons-Hexagons-and-Octagons-as-interlocking-shapes.jpg</a>)<br><br>These ***shapes can also be used as puzzle pieces to create a larger composition***<br>&nbsp;and organize information, such as in an infographic. With hexagons, you<br>&nbsp;can design a beehive style composition with analogous colors. With<br>pentagons and octagons you can design something similar in either<br>horizontal, vertical and even diagonal directions.<br><br>Pentagons, hexagons and octagons can<br>also be separated into smaller shapes such as triangles to create a<br>progression with a visually circular motion or a visualization similar<br>to a pie chart.<br><br>## *Natural Shapes*<br><br>![Natural-Shapes How-to-Creatively-Use-Shapes&nbsp;to-Make-Your-Designs-Stand-Out-geometric meanings](<a data-fr-linked="true" href="https://visme.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Natural-Shapes.jpg">https://visme.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Natural-Shapes.jpg</a>)<br><br>Natural or organic shapes represent &nbsp;***things and animals found in the natural world*** , such as leaves, flowers, trees, or man-made things like paint splatter and ink droplets.<br><br>You should definitely use these shapes if your design is related to<br>the environment or ecology. These kinds of shapes also work great for<br>graphics about the great outdoors, like hiking, camping and the like. If<br>&nbsp;your business has to do with flowers, then you can go beyond just using<br>&nbsp;images of real flowers by using natural shapes as accessories for your<br>graphics.<br><br>You can use natural shapes on their<br>own or as part of a larger composition, such as in the examples below.<br>But keep in mind that these kinds of shapes have a clear meaning and<br>message&mdash;they are not very subliminal at all.<br><br>![examples of natural organic shapes in designs How-to-Creatively-Use-Shapes&nbsp;to-Make-Your-Designs-Stand-Out-geometric meanings](<a data-fr-linked="true" href="https://visme.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Ecology-and-the-Great-Outdoors-2.jpg">https://visme.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Ecology-and-the-Great-Outdoors-2.jpg</a>)<br><br>## *Symbols and Icons*<br><br>![How-to-Creatively-Use-Shapes-to-Make-Your-Designs-Stand-Out-Symbols-and-Icons](<a data-fr-linked="true" href="https://visme.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/How-to-Creatively-Use-Shapes-to-Make-Your-Designs-Stand-Out-Symbols-and-Icons.jpg">https://visme.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/How-to-Creatively-Use-Shapes-to-Make-Your-Designs-Stand-Out-Symbols-and-Icons.jpg</a>)<br><br>Symbols and icons are kinds of &nbsp;***abstract shapes** *.<br>&nbsp;They can represent ordinary things and they can also carry a higher<br>symbolism, either religious, political or cultural. Symbols and icons<br>are especially useful when creating graphics because they convey<br>messages quickly.<br><br>The difference between symbols and<br>shapes is that regular shapes can be used in greater quantity within a<br>design, while too many symbols can be overwhelming and can create<br>confusion. Keep the use of symbols to a minimum, and if you do use them,<br>&nbsp;choose them wisely.<br><br>Icons are often seen in infographic<br>design to minimize the use of text and call attention to certain key<br>messages. But you need to choose icons carefully in order to stay on<br>brand. Make sure you change the color scheme of your icons to fit your<br>brand and only use one style of icon within the same infographic.<br><br>[RELATED: How to Select and Use Icons in Your Infographics](<a data-fr-linked="true" href="https://visme.co/blog/how-to-use-icons-in-infographics/">https://visme.co/blog/how-to-use-icons-in-infographics/</a>)<br><br>## *Stars*<br><br>Besides geometric shapes, stars can<br>also be considered symbols as they are often used in religious<br>depictions and have a variety of connotations. Stars are memorable and<br>often &nbsp;***symbolize notoriety and importance*** . Our eyes will always be drawn to a star (especially if it&rsquo;s yellow or gold) before any other shape.<br><br>Stars are great shapes for framing<br>sale prices, special information about a product or promotion, a<br>discount or a bonus. Yellow stars can remind us of the golden stars we<br>received as students, while blue stars will bring to mind first-place<br>ribbons.

Bold, solid arrows will<br>convey more strength than thin or hollow arrows. Squiggly arrows<br>can give your design a playful air. Arrows can be quite small, for use<br>in bullet lists, or quite large to house text inside them. Concentric<br>arrows, in triangle or circular forms, can be used to represent cycles<br>and processes. The international symbol for recycling is a triangle made<br>&nbsp;out of arrows.<br><br>### *Direction*<br><br>An arrow&rsquo;s greatest purpose is to &nbsp;**convey direction** .<br>&nbsp;Using arrows can help your viewer follow a path of information from one<br>&nbsp;part of your graphic to another. You can also use arrows in<br>&ldquo;before-and-after&rdquo; graphics or other sorts of transformations. Like with<br>&nbsp;icons, it&rsquo;s best to stay on brand and use a consistent style of arrow<br>throughout your design. If you use hand-drawn arrows in one infographic,<br>&nbsp;you should not combine them with thick, blocky arrows.<br><br>## *Shapes and Symbols of the Digital Generation*<br><br>### *Emojis*<br><br>Using emojis in graphics is quickly<br>becoming a trend that doesn&rsquo;t seem like it will go away very soon. If<br>your clientele is comprised mostly of young people, you should look into<br>&nbsp;using emojis in your graphics. Millennials text using emojis instead of words. Why not tap into that and use it to your advantage?<br><br>### *Pin Drops*<br><br>Pin drops are the shapes we have come<br>&nbsp;to know via Google maps and other location apps. You can use customized<br>&nbsp;pin drops in your graphics and maps if you have a travel company, for<br>example. [Visme](<a data-fr-linked="true" href="https://www.visme.co/?vc=In-Text-Blog-CTA">https://www.visme.co/?vc=In-Text-Blog-CTA</a>) has an entire section of pin drops in its icon library!<br><br>## *Staying on Brand with Shapes*<br><br>One thing we need to keep in mind<br>when using shapes to create graphics for our visual marketing strategy<br>is that we should always stay on brand. When creating a visual style<br>guide, you should **establish a selection of shapes** that are to be used for all brand graphics. Try not to use shapes willy-nilly every time you create a new graphic.<br><br>If your squares and rectangles always<br>&nbsp;have rounded corners, keep it that way. If you use octagons to frame<br>text, then always use octagons.<br><br>Think of your readers, clients and<br>followers. They will remember your brand better if they can say<br>something like, &ldquo;that brand with the cool hexagon,&rdquo; or &ldquo;that brand with<br>the concentric arrows.&rdquo; Keeping a conscious consistency is key to<br>staying true to your visual identity.</p>
